## Install

install requirement

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Pool

To run the code in the `Pool` folder, navigate to it and execute the following command:

```bash
python main.py --url RSTP_ADDRESS --port RSTP_PORT --username RSTP_USERNAME --password RSTP_PASSWORD --path RSTP_PATH
```

Replace `RSTP_ADDRESS`, `RSTP_PORT`, `RSTP_USERNAME`, `RSTP_PASSWORD`, and `RSTP_PATH` with your actual values.

The `Nodes` folder contains three subfolders: `Node1`, `Node2`, and `Node3`. To run the code in each of these nodes, navigate to the respective node folder and execute the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

Please ensure that you have the necessary permissions and dependencies installed before running these commands. Enjoy coding!
